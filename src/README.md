Program Description:
This is a program written in java that contains 2 calcultors. One calculator prints out your mortgage value and the other returns the interest earned after a CD has matured.

in my code I added a method that handles scanner input and if in the first stages if the scanner doesn't recognize the input it asks the user to try again.
this method isn't perfected yet as it only works in the beginning and some of the code is redundent.
